# Custom Linters

A monorepo for various custom lint rules that can enhance your Flutter and Dart code quality.
Currently, this repository includes:

- **[go_router_linter](./packages/go_router_linter)**: A set of lint rules for the `go_router` package, helping you maintain consistent and robust route definitions in your Flutter apps.
- **[flutter_best_practices_lints](./packages/flutter_best_practices_lints)**: A collection of lint rules that enforce common best practices in Flutter development, such as matching class names to file names and ensuring only one main class per file.

## Contents

- **`packages/`**
  - [go_router_linter](./packages/go_router_linter): Contains the rules and tests for the `go_router_linter`.
  - [flutter_best_practices_lints](./packages/flutter_best_practices_lints): Contains the rules, tests, and example app for enforcing best practices in Flutter projects.
